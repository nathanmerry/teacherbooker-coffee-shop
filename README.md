## Cloud Services Strategy

The cloud services I would use would depend on the expected size and traffic of the application.

### For a Small-Scale App (e.g., a Local Coffee Shop with Low Traffic)
Given my experience with DigitalOcean and Google Cloud:

- **DigitalOcean**: I find DigitalOcean very user-friendly and cost-effective for smaller projects. I would likely use DigitalOcean to host both the frontend and backend. Both the front and back end could be hosted on the App Platform. For the database, I would use a digital ocean managed PostgreSQL database.

- **Google Cloud**: Alternatively, for slightly larger setups, I might use Google Cloud's App Engine for the backend and Cloud Storage for the frontend. Google Cloud's managed services provide strong support for scaling if the application grows over time.

### For a Larger-Scale App (e.g., Multiple Coffee Shops with High Traffic)
If the application were to scale and require more robust infrastructure, AWS also provides services for building scailable web applications. While I don't have direct experience with AWS, I would explore using the following services:

- **AWS Amplify**: To host and manage the frontend, especially if it's a React or static site, AWS Amplify offers a streamlined process with built-in CI/CD capabilities.
  
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Lambda**: For the backend, AWS Elastic Beanstalk could be used for deploying and scaling web applications easily. If the architecture leans towards microservices or serverless functions, AWS Lambda might be a suitable choice.

- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)**: For the database, Amazon RDS would be ideal for managing a PostgreSQL database with automated backups, patching, and scaling.

### Conclusion
While I am most comfortable with DigitalOcean and Google Cloud, which I have used in previous projects, I understand that AWS is a powerful option for larger-scale applications.
